# This file defines your production environment.
# It tells Docker which "services" (containers) to run and how they connect.

services:
  # 1. NGINX: The Front Desk
  # It handles all incoming traffic (Port 80 and 443) and sends it to your app.
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    volumes:
      # Connect your local configuration to the container
      - ./nginx/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
      # Storage for SSL certificates (provided by Certbot)
      - ./nginx/data/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./nginx/data/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    # This command makes Nginx reload every 6 hours to check for new SSL certs.
    command: "/bin/sh -c 'while :; do sleep 6h & wait $${!}; nginx -s reload; done & nginx -g \"daemon off;\"'"
    depends_on:
      - frontend
      - backend

  # 2. CERTBOT: The Security Guard
  # It automatically talks to "Let's Encrypt" to get and renew your free SSL certificates.
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/data/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./nginx/data/certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    # Tries to renew certificates every 12 hours.
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"

  # 3. BACKEND: The Kitchen
  # This runs your Python/FastAPI code.
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      # 'Mount' your code so changes can be seen (though in production we usually bake code into the image)
      - ./backend/app:/app/app
    environment:
      # These variables are pulled from your server's '.env' file
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    ports:
      # Only allow connections from inside the server (localhost) for security.
      - "127.0.0.1:8000:8000"

  # 4. FRONTEND: The Face
  # This runs your React/TypeScript code.
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      target: production # Use the 'production' stage from the Dockerfile
      args:
        # Pass keys needed at 'build time' (when the code is being compiled)
        - REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=${REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
        - OBFUSCATE=true # Set to true to scramble your code for privacy
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend

# Networks allow containers to talk to each other using their names (e.g., 'http://backend:8000')
